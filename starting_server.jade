    h1 How to start the server
    p You need to:
        ul
            li set a spring profile
            li create a file /etc/trackr.properties <i>or</i> add some properties to the application.properties for your used profile (see below).

    h2 Selecting the right profile
    p.
        You can set the profile as a JVM parameter for the servlet container: -Dspring.profiles.active=dev. The options are dev, qs or prod.
        To play around with it the dev profile is the right thing. It uses a H2 in memory database and no actual mail sending.

    h2 Setting needed properties
    p You need to set some properties in a configuration file. There are three options. Assume you have selected the profile PROFILE (i.e. PROFILE=dev, qs or prod)
        ol
            li Create a file /etc/track.properties
            li Edit your application_PROFILE.properties in src/main/resources and add
                pre trackr.externalconfig=/path/to/your/properties/file
            li Set the properties directly in your application_PROFILE.properties file.
        p After you have chosen what file you want to edit add the following properties:
        p For all profiles:
            pre.
                # the redirect URIs that are allowed in OAuth authorization for the client trackr-page, can be left like this
                oauth.trackr-page.redirect_uris=http://localhost
                # If you run this application behind a reverse proxy set the path here
                # E.g. if you map this application to http://localhost/trackr set this to trackr
                proxy.path=
        p For qs and prod: The passwords for the domain database and OAuth database.
            pre.
                database.password=
                tokenDatabase.password=
        p Now the application should be able to start.
